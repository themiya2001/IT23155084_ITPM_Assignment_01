 # ITPM Assignment 1 – End-to-End Testing using Playwright

## Module
IT3040 – Information Technology Project Management (ITPM)

## Assignment Overview
This project contains automated end-to-end test cases for evaluating a real-world
Singlish to Sinhala transliteration system available at:
https://www.swifttranslator.com/

The main objective of this assignment is to validate:
- Accuracy of Singlish to Sinhala conversion
- Robustness under different input conditions
- User Interface (UI) behavior such as real-time output updating

Backend APIs, performance, and security testing are intentionally excluded as per the assignment scope.

---

## Testing Approach
All test cases are implemented as *end-to-end (E2E) tests* using Playwright.

The tests simulate real user behavior by:
- Entering Singlish text into the input field
- Observing automatic real-time Sinhala output
- Validating correct or expected behavior for both valid and invalid inputs
